# Village Simulation
Multithreaded app done as a project for Operating Systems (Systemy Operacyjne 2) course at the university.

Authors: [Wojciech Ormaniec][Github TheMesoria]

It was meant to be our collaborative project, but it turned out [TheMesoria][Github TheMesoria] did all the work. I haven't even attended the final presentation.

Tbh I don't even know how or if this works. I just leave it here as it helped me pass that course.

It was meant to be a simple simulation of a small village with some variety of available jobs for every single villager.
